KoL Miner - Kingdom of Loathing (www.kingdomofloathing.com) chrome extension for miners

This Chrome extension makes "promising" sections of wall look _really_ promising, replacing
the sparkle graphic with a clear "MINE HERE" message.

To install, open chrome://extensions/ in your browser, and enable "Developer mode" in the upper
right corner of the screen. Then click "load unpacked", and point it at the "extension" directory.
You won't see any obvious effect until the next time you go to That '70s Volcano or Itznotyerzitz
mine, but when you do go there, it should be pretty obvious.

The code is tiny, and probably not optimal - but it tooks me a couple of hours to research how
to do it, so hopefully I can save someone some time and hassle.
